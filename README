Astrid JS Library

This project is intended primarily as a guide on writing applications
against Astrid's RPC web API. It also doubles as a perfectly capable (albeit
limited) Javascript library for writing plugin apps for Astrid.

While we hope that our API isn't changing all the time, it's possible that
this project becomes out of date. If this is ever the case, create an issue
for us and we'll get on it as soon as we can.

Thanks!
